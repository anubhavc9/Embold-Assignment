# Embold-Assignment

index.html file can be directly opened for demonstration purpose

## Tech stack used
HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript

## Note:
* The design is fairly responsive
* Comments have been added in the code, wherever necessary
* Users can be added or removed using the "user_list" array of JSON objects, in the _script.js_ file
* First name, last name, username fields in the form can only have small or captial letters & digits 0-9 only. _No whitespaces or symbols have been allowed._
* As an extra, I've made the user list search bar functional as well
